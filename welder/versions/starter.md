This `readme.md` file was created automatically to help you document your project:

- When a project folder is opened in the web browser on  [wevolver.com](https://www.wevolver.com/about), the `readme.md` file is detected and its contents are automatically displayed to the user.

- This makes the `readme.md` file an excellent tool for providing detailed information about your project or folder to other contributors or the public.

We have provided an example template below to help you get the most out of your `readme.md` files.
This template is by no means comprehensive but is intended as a useful starting point for you to get your project off the ground as quickly as possible.

Please feel free to use the template below or develop your own structure to the `readme.md` files.
You can also delete or replace the contents of this `readme.md` as required.

### Introduction

The `Introduction` section provides a board overview of your project and the team members currently involved.

It may also include information relating to:

- What is your project goal?
- What are your criteria for success?
- What are the potential risks and obstacles? 

You can also provide a back story for your project that includes team motivations and values.

Note:
This section will be used by team members and contributors from different backgrounds and disciplines so try to keep it free from industry specific jargon where possible.

### Contributing

If you're seeking to attract contributors, please include details on current objectives, short-term challenges, and the skills that the project requires.

This is also an ideal section to reference a 'single point of contact' e.g. an existing team member who will be responsible for answering questions and onboarding new contributors.

### License

If you're working on a public project, please include license details in this section.
You can find out more about Open Hardware Licenses at the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/).
