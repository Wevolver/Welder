### Description

The `Description` section can be used to explain what your project does.
A good description is clear and to the point.

### Making

Give people information on where how and where to start when they'd like to start making your project. For example refer to where they can find an assembly instruction.

### Contributing

If you're seeking to attract contributors, please include details on current objectives, short-term challenges, and the skills that the project requires.
This is also an ideal section to reference a 'single point of contact' e.g. an existing team member who will be responsible for answering questions and onboarding new contributors.

### License
If you're working on a public project, please include license details in this section.
You can find out more about Open Hardware Licenses at the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/).
