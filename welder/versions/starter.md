> This `readme.md` file was created automatically to help you document your project:  
 When you view a project folder, the content of the `readme.md` file in the folder is automatically displayed.  
You can use the `readme.md` file to provide information about your project to team members or the public.

> Good documentation is key to the success of any project.
Below is an example template for public projects to help you get the most out of your `readme.md` files.
Readme files use a format called Markdown, read more [here to learn how to style your Readme](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/).

## Readme Template:

### Description

The `Description` section can be used to explain what your project does.
A good description is clear and to the point.

### Making

Give people information on where how and where to start when they'd like to start making your project. For example refer to where they can find an assembly instruction.

### Contributing

If you're seeking to attract contributors, please include details on current objectives, short-term challenges, and the skills that the project requires.
This is also an ideal section to reference a 'single point of contact' e.g. an existing team member who will be responsible for answering questions and onboarding new contributors.

### License
If you're working on a public project, please include license details in this section.
You can find out more about Open Hardware Licenses at the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/).
