We created this file to help you get started documenting your project. Any file with the name `readme.md` will be loaded automatically when you open the folder it's located in.

This document can contain whatever you'd like, but the following sections provide a good starting point.

### About The Project

In this section you can give a bit of back story for your project including motivations and values.

### Getting Started

Then it's a good idea to let new users know how to get started working with the project.

### Contributing

Finally, if you're looking for help, you should tell new users how they can contribute. This should include future goals and short term challenges.
