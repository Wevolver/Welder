> This `documentation.md` file was created automatically to help you document your project:  
 When you view a project folder, the content of the `documentation.md` file in the folder is automatically displayed.  

> Good documentation is key to the success of any project.
Below is an example template for public projects to help you get the most out of your `documentation.md` files.
Documentation files use a format called Markdown, read more [here to learn how to style your Documentation](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/).

## Documentation Template:

### Description

The `Description` section can be used to explain what your project does.
A good description is clear and to the point. This is also a good place to add
the goal of and motivation for the project.

### Resources

The `Resources` section can be used to tell your team members where to look for
more information.
This is also a good place to document who to contact for help.

### Contents

Because `documentation` files are loaded as soon as you enter a new folder, they
are also a good place to provide a quick description of what the folders contain.
